# GRPC

gRPC is an open source Remote Procedure Call (RPC) system initially developed at Google. It uses HTTP/2 for transport, Protocol Buffers as the interface description language, and provides features such as authentication, bidirectional streaming and flow control, blocking or nonblocking bindings, and cancellation and timeouts. 
It generates cross-platform client and server bindings for many languages. Most common usage scenarios include connecting services in microservices style architecture and connect mobile devices, browser clients to backend services.

  ### Protocol buffers
  Protocol Buffers (Protobuf) is a method of serializing structured data.
