# GRPC

gRPC is an open source Remote Procedure Call (RPC) system initially developed at Google. It uses HTTP/2 for transport, Protocol Buffers as the interface description language, and provides features such as authentication, bidirectional streaming and flow control, blocking or nonblocking bindings, and cancellation and timeouts. 
It generates cross-platform client and server bindings for many languages. Most common usage scenarios include connecting services in microservices style architecture and connect mobile devices, browser clients to backend services.

  ### Protocol buffers
  Protocol Buffers (Protobuf) is a method of serializing structured data.

# REST
REST is acronym for REpresentational State Transfer. It is architectural style for distributed hypermedia systems. REST is a lightweight alternative to mechanisms like RPC (Remote Procedure Calls). 

# Webhook
A webhook (also called a web callback or HTTP push API) is a way for an app to provide other applications with real-time information. A webhook delivers data to other applications as it happens, meaning you get data immediately. Unlike typical APIs where you would need to poll for data very frequently in order to get it real-time. This makes webhooks much more efficient for both provider and consumer. The only drawback to webhooks is the difficulty of initially setting them up.

# SOAP
SOAP is a standard communication protocol system that permits processes using different operating systems like Linux and Windows to communicate via HTTP and XML.
