### DB Schema
The database schema of a database is its structure described in a formal language supported by the database management system.

### DB Constraints
Constraints are the rules enforced on the data columns of a table. These are used to limit the type of data that can go into a table. This ensures the accuracy and reliability of the data in the database.
  Some of the most commonly used constraints available in SQL
    #### Not NULL
    #### Foreign key
    #### Unique

### API endpoint
An endpoint is a URL pattern used to communicate with an API.

### API Gateway
An API gateway takes all API calls from clients, then routes them to the appropriate microservice with request routing, composition, and protocol translation. Typically it handles a request by invoking multiple microservices and aggregating the results, to determine the best path.

### Serialization
Serialization is the process of converting an object into a stream of bytes to store the object or transmit it to memory, a database, or a file. Its main purpose is to save the state of an object in order to be able to recreate it when needed. The reverse process is called deserialization.
